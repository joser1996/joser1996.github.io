    The purpose of this project, Senior Design, was to become familiar with creating
    projects on IOS. The goal set by the client was to create a multiplayer
    game that implements AR Technology. The game we, my team and I, created
    was a base defending game. The player can set down a base on a flat surface
    and must defend it from oncoming zombies.

    Application built using python. Purpose is to allow user to take a public
    youtube playlist and generate a spotify playlist based on the titles of the
    videos. First Version works, but isn't user friendly. Intend to make it more
    user friendly so other people aside from the developer, me, can use it.
