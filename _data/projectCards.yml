    The purpose of this project, Senior Design, was to become familiar with creating
    projects on IOS. The goal set by the client was to create a multiplayer
    game that implements AR Technology. The game we, my team and I, created
    was a base defending game. The player can set down a base on a flat surface
    and must defend it from oncoming zombies.
