    Basic features have been implemented. User can log in via google using the
    passport module. The back end is written in JS using express. User can
    use the website to enter any word or text in the left box. On "enter"
    a Japanese translation is obtained, using google translate API, and stored
    via MongoDB. I plan to allow the user to select new language and create
    multiple decks instead of a big one.

    The main premise of the game is to allow the user to set a "base" on some
    flat surface and defend it from waves of "zombies". You use the phones camera
    to aim and shoot. Up to 4 player can play together and waves and zombies are
    synchronzied across all devices.
